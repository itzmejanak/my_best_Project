# JavaScript Background Color Switcher

This is a basic JavaScript project that allows users to switch the background color of a webpage by clicking on different color buttons.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: The CSS file containing the styles for the webpage.
- `scripts.js`: The JavaScript file containing the functionality to switch background colors.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. You will see color buttons on the page. Click on any button to change the background color of the webpage.

## How it Works

- The `scripts.js` file selects the body element and all color buttons on the webpage.
- It adds event listeners to each color button so that when clicked, it changes the background color of the body element.
- The background color changes based on the id of the clicked button.
