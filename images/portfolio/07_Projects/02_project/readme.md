# Visual Basic .NET BMI Calculator

## Description

This project is a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator implemented in Visual Basic .NET. It provides a simple interface for users to calculate their BMI based on their height in centimeters and weight in kilograms. Additionally, it offers guidance on interpreting the BMI results according to standard weight categories.

## Project Structure

- **index.html:** Contains the HTML structure of the BMI calculator webpage.
- **style.css:** Includes the CSS styles for styling the webpage elements.
- **scripts.js:** Implements the JavaScript functionality for calculating the BMI and providing weight category guidance.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project solution in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project to launch the BMI calculator application.
4. Input your height in centimeters and weight in kilograms into the respective fields.
5. Click the "Calculate" button to see your BMI result and weight category guidance.

## How it Works

- The BMI calculation logic is implemented in the `scripts.js` file using JavaScript.
- The JavaScript code listens for form submission events, calculates the BMI based on the provided height and weight, and displays the result on the webpage.
- Additionally, the JavaScript code adjusts the styling of the weight category guidance based on the calculated BMI result.
