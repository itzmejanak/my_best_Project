# Your Local Time Display

## Description

This project is a simple web application that displays the local time of the user. It provides a clean and minimalistic interface with a banner indicating "Your local time" and a dynamic clock displaying the current time.

## Project Structure

- **index.html:** Contains the HTML structure of the webpage.
- **styles.css:** Includes the CSS styles for styling the webpage elements.
- **scripts.js:** Implements the JavaScript functionality for updating and displaying the local time.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. The webpage will display a banner indicating "Your local time" and a clock showing the current time.
4. The clock will automatically update every second to reflect the accurate local time.

## How it Works

- The JavaScript code in `scripts.js` selects the clock element from the HTML and updates its content with the current local time.
- It uses the `setInterval` function to update the time every second, ensuring that the displayed time is always accurate.
- The CSS file `styles.css` contains styles to enhance the appearance of the webpage, including font weight and centering elements.
